# 6. Token Utility & Governance Framework (Finalized 10/10 Version)

The $FASS token is not just currency — it’s programmable power. It defines who gets to build, own, earn from, and govern the entire decentralized FASS franchise ecosystem.

| 🔓 Franchise Access | Franchisees | Stake $FASS to unlock brand kits, launchpads, training & support |
| 🗳 Voting Rights | DAO Members | 1 token = 1 vote (plus weight tiers and loyalty boosts) |

## 🔁 Dynamic Staking & Reputation

| Duration | Voting Multiplier | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| 90 days | 1.2x | Encourages commitment |
| 180 days | 1.35x | Mid-term DAO influence |
| 365+ days | 1.5x | Full-strength ecosystem builder |

#### 🧠 Reputation Overlay
Reputation score factors in:
- Proposal writing
- Governance participation
- Tool contributions
- Franchise reviews
- Issue moderation

---

## 📈 Franchise DAO Performance Score

Each franchise earns a **DAO Influence Score** based on:
- Revenue performance
- Customer reviews
- Community engagement
- Compliance metrics

This determines the weight of votes by that brand’s stakers, promoting real-world results over passive holders.

---

## 🧠 Proposal Types

| Type | Who Can Submit | Quorum & Delay |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Module upgrades | Any Silver+ | 25% quorum, 72hr delay |
| Burn mechanic changes | Gold+ only | 50% quorum, 7-day delay |
| Treasury allocation | Bronze+ | 33% quorum, 5-day delay |
| Emergency pause | Gold+ or dev multi-sig | 75% quorum, 24hr execution window |

---

## 🛡 Emergency Override Circuit

A high-security governance override to:
- Pause token flows
- Freeze contract functions
- Lock DAO temporarily

**Trigger:**  
- 75% DAO vote  
- OR dev multisig w/ external audit & 24h public veto window

---

## 🔁 Burn to Treasury Reallocation Logic

By default:
- Burn pool reduces token supply

By DAO vote:
- Burn pool can be **re-routed** into:
  - Yield farming pool
  - Dividend distribution
  - Liquidity incentives
  - Ecosystem re-investment

This creates optional yield for mature phases while maintaining deflation in early stages.

## 🧩 Proof-of-Impact Role Unlocks

Instead of just "staking to govern," FASS encourages contribution:

| Role | Access Method | Powers |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Franchisee | Stake $FASS | Access kits + co-own brand |
| Builder | Contribute & stake | Propose modules + earn DAO bounties |
| Voter | Stake or earn reputation | Vote on upgrades, elections, growth |
| Governor | Elected by DAO | Manage roadmap, major spend, final sign-offs |
| Partner | Lock $FASS | Launch tokenized brands or AI integrations |

## 🤖 Francis AI Governance Enhancements

Every proposal generates an auto-summarized digest by Francis:
- Easy-to-read
- Risk-scored
- Linked to all relevant modules or treasury impacts

---

## ⚖️ Closing Notes

This framework makes $FASS:

- Deflationary in the short-term
- Yield-generating in the long-term
- Governed by **contribution and performance**, not just whales
- Powered by AI for transparency and speed
