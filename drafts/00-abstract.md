# Abstract

FASS (Franchise Automation & Scaling System) is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize the global franchise industry by removing gatekeepers, lowering startup costs, and empowering communities to own, govern, and grow real-world businesses.

Using smart contracts, DAO-based governance, and franchise automation tools, FASS enables any qualified individual or group to submit, vet, launch, and scale franchises â€” while earning and participating in token-based ownership.

At its core, FASS combines Web3 infrastructure with real-world entrepreneurship to create a scalable, permissionless system where brands like Munchies and Holy Smoke Wings are just the beginning.

This white paper introduces the foundational components of FASS, including its governance structure, franchise builder, $FASS token utility, economic model, and long-term roadmap toward a decentralized franchise economy.
