# Market Opportunity

FASS is positioned at the intersection of three powerful markets:

---

## 1. 🏪 Franchising (Traditional)

- **Global Franchise Market Size:** $860B+ (as of 2024)
- **Annual Growth Rate:** 9.7% CAGR
- **Franchise Units in U.S.:** Over 800,000
- **Top Sectors:** Food service, home services, retail, education

**Problems in the space:**
- 92% of franchise applicants are rejected due to lack of capital
- Failure to innovate: Most new ideas never get funded
- High cost of entry (often $100K–$500K+)

---

## 2. 🌐 Web3 & Token Economies

- **Global Crypto Market Cap:** $2T+ (as of 2025)
- **DAO Growth:** Over $20B in DAO treasuries
- **New Trend:** Tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), IP, and businesses

**Current gap:**
- Web3 has no real-world business-to-consumer franchise system
- DAOs often govern protocols, not physical operations
- Most tokens have weak real-world utility

---

## 3. 💸 The Ownership Economy

- Millions of people are turning side hustles into full-time businesses
- Gen Z & Millennials prefer co-ownership, not just employment
- Huge demand for local brands with global reach

---

## Why Now?

- Post-COVID market has exploded with ghost kitchens, mobile services, and low-overhead startups
- No platform exists to standardize and fund these at scale
- Governments and investors are pushing for real-world crypto adoption

---

## 📈 FASS TAM (Total Addressable Market)

- **Starter Franchises ($10K–$50K):** 10M+ potential global users
- **Franchise Support Industry:** $100B+
- **Tokenized Marketplace Sales:** $20B–$50B in potential over 5 years
