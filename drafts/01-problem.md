# The Problem

Franchising has traditionally been one of the most reliable wealth-building models — but it's locked behind excessive capital requirements, limited access, and centralized gatekeepers.

## 🚫 Barriers in Traditional Franchising

- **High Buy-In Costs:** Most established franchises require $100K–$1M+ to get started.
- **Restricted Ownership:** Only individuals with capital or connections are approved.
- **Centralized Control:** Brand owners make all decisions, often with no community input.
- **Slow Innovation:** New concepts rarely break through unless funded by venture capital.
- **Corporate Greed:** Fees, royalties, and compliance rules often crush local owners.

## ⚠️ Web3 Doesn’t Fix This Alone

Despite the rise of DeFi and DAOs, most Web3 projects have:
- No real-world business model
- No cashflow or utility
- No plan to onboard real people from underserved communities

## 🧠 The Opportunity

There’s a gap between **franchises that work** and **systems that decentralize**.  
FASS bridges that gap by combining:
- Proven IRL brand models
- Token-driven governance
- Community ownership
- A replicable blueprint

FASS isn’t trying to reinvent franchises — it’s trying to unlock them for everyone.
