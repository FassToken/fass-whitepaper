| Mechanism            | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Licensing Fee Burn   | 1% of every franchise sale burned automatically           |
| Annual Burn Tapering | Burn rate increases 1% per year (1% → 2% → 3%)            |
| Premium Tool Burn    | Tokens used for upgrades partially burned                 |
| Exit Penalty Burn    | Franchise opt-outs trigger burn of staked $FASS          |

> 💡 Every cycle → fewer tokens, more demand.

## 💵 Revenue Sharing Model

Revenue from real-world franchise operations flows back into the ecosystem:

| Source               | Split                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Franchise Royalties  | 1% to DAO Treasury, 1% to stakers, 1% burned  |
| Marketplace Fees     | 2% to DAO, 1% to franchise creator             |
| Premium AI/Tools     | Partial burn, partial treasury reallocation   |

> Stakers receive **passive income** tied to **real-world revenue**.

---

## 🔁 Adaptive Burn Allocation (DAO Upgrade Path)

Initially, all burn functions are hard-coded. However, after certain milestones (e.g. 100 franchises launched, $10M revenue), the DAO may vote to reallocate burn % into a dividend pool.

| Phase     | Burn | Dividend | Treasury |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|
| Year 1–2  | 3%   | 0%       | 0%       |
| Year 3–4  | 2%   | 1%       | 0%       |
| Year 5+   | 1%   | 1.5%     | 0.5%     |

> Dividends go to long-term stakers or NFT-bound operators with strong reputation.

## 🔗 Franchise NFT + Token Binding

Each franchise is issued as an NFT.  
Staking $FASS **into the NFT** grants:

- Operational access
- DAO-linked identity
- Rev-share entitlement
- History, ratings, audit logs

> A new hybrid model: **token = license + equity + brand passport**

---

## 🧠 Governance Mechanics

- Proposal Submission: Requires staked $FASS + activity
- Voting Power: Tokens × time staked × reputation score
- Quorum Rules: Based on proposal type
- Smart Contracts: All votes executed on-chain with delay + emergency veto

> Long-term contributors earn **non-transferrable reputation multipliers**.

---

## 🏛 Treasury Policy

- Max release: **5% per quarter**
- Public treasury dashboard
- DAO can burn unused tokens, reallocate, or reinvest

> Ensures **long-term solvency + fiscal discipline**

---

## ♻️ Lifecycle Flow

```text
→ Stake $FASS
→ Vote in Arena
→ Brand wins
→ DAO mints NFT + kit
→ Franchise launches
→ Revenue split + tokens burned
→ Treasury grows
→ DAO reinvests or pays dividends
→ Repeat.
TOKEN STAKING → GOVERNANCE → BRAND LAUNCH → REVENUE → YIELD + BURN → CIRCULATE
