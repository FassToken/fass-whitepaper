# System Architecture

FASS is an ecosystem composed of smart contracts, automation modules, token governance, and real-world brand infrastructure ‚Äî all designed to make franchise ownership open and scalable.

## üß± Core Layers

### 1. Application Layer (Franchisee & User Interfaces)
- Franchise onboarding dashboard
- Franchise kit builder
- Voting portals (Arena & DAO)
- Marketplace UI (coming soon)
- Managed via web & mobile interfaces (Wix, React, or Velo)

### 2. Protocol Layer (Smart Contracts)
- Token minting & distribution
- DAO proposal submission & voting logic
- Franchise ownership registry
- Kit licensing & royalty flows
- Staking and reward logic

Smart contracts live on Ethereum-compatible chains (Polygon, Arbitrum, or custom L2).

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- IPFS or Arweave for storage of SOPs, menus, templates
- GitHub (open source kits & modules)
- Google Drive for secure offline docs (franchise-operator controlled)
- Email + SMS integration for franchise automation tools

## üîÅ Workflow Flowchart

Here‚Äôs how a franchise brand moves through the system:

1. **Idea submission** (Arena entry)
2. **Community voting** (win = test round)
3. **Test MVP launched** (food truck, kit, or pop-up)
4. **Data & results collected**
5. **DAO votes on expansion**
6. **Franchise enters FASS ecosystem**
7. **Franchise kits minted + listed**
8. **Franchise owners onboarded via dashboard**
9. **Ongoing governance + revenue shared via smart contracts**

## üß† Technical Stack (Suggested)

| Function | Tool |
|---------|------|
| Frontend | Wix Velo (MVP), React.js (scaling) |
| Backend | Node.js or Supabase |
| Blockchain | Solidity smart contracts on Polygon or Arbitrum |
| Storage | IPFS / Arweave |
| AI Assistant | OpenAI API (Francis) |
| Auth & Payments | Magic.link, WalletConnect, Stripe |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

---

## üîê Data & Security

- Franchise kits and ownership records are anchored on-chain
- Admin controls limited by DAO rules
- Royalties and franchisee payments are permissionlessly distributed
- Kits are tokenized and transferable, but with usage rights tied to DAO rules

---

## üîÑ Composability

Everything in FASS is modular:
- Kits can be updated by DAO proposals
- Smart contracts can be forked and reused
- Brands can launch their own sub-DAOs or utility tokens within the ecosystem

---

FASS is not a single app ‚Äî it‚Äôs an architecture to launch **a thousand decentralized brands**, all governed under one scalable system.
