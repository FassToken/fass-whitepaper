## ⚖️ Legal Status of the $FASS Token

$FASS is a **utility token**, not a security.

- It grants access to decentralized tools, governance, staking features, and platform services.
- $FASS does not represent ownership in a company, profit-sharing guarantees, or equity in any legal entity.
- It is not designed to appreciate in value or generate passive income through promises.

The token’s value, utility, and governance rights are determined entirely by DAO voting, user activity, and marketplace interactions.
